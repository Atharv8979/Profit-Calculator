### Problem Statement
Shopkeepers need to calculate whether an item sold gives them profit, loss, or neither.  
Doing this manually for every product can be slow and mistakes can happen.  
The purpose of this project is to build a simple Python program that calculates profit or loss based on the Cost Price (CP) and Selling Price (SP).

The program should:
- Accept CP and SP as input  
- Calculate profit/loss amount  
- Calculate percentage  
- Store each result in a CSV file  
- Allow the user to view or clear the stored history  
- Use modular programming with multiple `.py` files

### Scope of the Project
The project covers:
- Taking user input  
- Performing basic arithmetic calculations  
- Saving data to a CSV file  
- Reading data from CSV  
- Implementing clear menu navigation  
- Using multiple modules for better organization 

### Objective
- To develop a menu-driven Python application  
- To use modular programming concepts  
- To understand file handling using CSV  
- To make the code simple, readable, and easy to execute  
- To apply basic Python concepts learned in the course

### Problem Justification
A mistake in calculating profit or loss can affect the shopkeeper’s decisions.
Automating this ensures:
-Faster calculation
-No manual errors
-Easy access to past results
-More organized tracking

### Output
The user should be able to:
- Enter CP and SP  
- See whether they made profit or loss  
- View all previous calculations  
- Clear all stored data if required
